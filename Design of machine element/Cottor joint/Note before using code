This Python code will give safe design of cotter joint with required load, materialand its material grade. 
Note : Always enter proper load in newton (N) not in kilo newton (kN) 
       Always enter proper material using design data book. 
       Always enter proper material grade using design data book. 
       If load changes dimention changes. If material changes FOS (Factor of safty also changes), this will change dimention. 
       Program is designed according to design data book.
